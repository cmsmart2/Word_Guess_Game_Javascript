# Word_Guess_Game_Javascript

Borderlands Word Guess Game created by Cera Smart

WHAT THE PROJECT DOES

Here's how this game works:

It's hangman style. Guess a letter to try to find the correct word. Be careful you only get 10 incorrect guesses.

WHY THE PROJECT IS USEFUL

The game fulfills a homework assignment for University of Kansas Boot Camp, August 2019 to February 2020. This let me practice more HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

HOW YOU CAN GET STARTED WITH THE PROJECT

Just play the game.
